miniRT is a raw C implementation of a ray tracing engine.
It renders static computer-generated images (CGI) without using high-level graphics APIs like OpenGL.
All the logic, math, and geometry were written by hand.
By simulating the behavior of light rays as they travel from a viewpoint (camera) and interact with objects, the program calculates the precise color of every pixel on the screen.
We implemented:

• Specular reflection to achieve a full Phong reflection model.
• Color disruption: checkerboard pattern.
• Colored and multi-spot lights.
• Bump map textures.
